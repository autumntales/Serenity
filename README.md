# Serenity - Chrome Extension
    Extension and an associated web app that a customer can use to detect their trigger words which will then be blurred as the user traverses a web page.
 # Description
    The extension once loaded will enable its users to input their custom trigger words. The exact words and sometimes the situation adding up to it are also blurred with ideally a counter showing the  number of trigger words in that webpage.
